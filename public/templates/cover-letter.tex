% Body
Lubrizol transforms industries through science and sustainability, and protecting the infrastructure that powers this innovation is a challenge I am eager to accept. As a security professional who understands that modern protection must be woven into the fabric of development rather than applied as a bandage, I am excited to apply for the Cloud Security Engineer role. My background in securing cloud-native environments and embedding resilience into the software lifecycle aligns perfectly with Lubrizol's mission to shape a safer future.

In my recent work, I have focused on strengthening global security postures across hybrid and cloud environments (AWS and Azure). I specialize in DevSecOps methodologies - collaborating closely with DevOps and application teams to integrate automated vulnerability assessments and security gates directly into CI/CD pipelines. By shifting security left, I have helped organizations reduce production vulnerabilities and accelerate remediation timelines. My experience extends to designing robust IAM policies, managing keys/secrets, and ensuring that infrastructure is "secure by design" before it ever reaches deployment.

I am deeply familiar with the rigor required to maintain compliance with international frameworks such as NIST, ISO 27001, and GDPR. I have successfully conducted risk evaluations and internal technical audits to identify blind spots, proactively mitigating threats before they impact business continuity. I combine this technical acumen with strong communication skills, allowing me to translate complex security risks into actionable insights for stakeholders and foster a culture where security is viewed as a shared responsibility.

I am eager to bring my expertise in threat monitoring, cloud architecture protection, and incident response to your team in Wickliffe. I am confident that my proactive approach to cybersecurity will help Lubrizol continue to deliver innovative solutions safely and reliably.

I would value the chance to discuss how I can help fortify Lubrizol's digital assets and contribute to your global security resilience. Thank you for your time and consideration.
