\textbf{To the Lubrizol Hiring Team,}

I’ve been following how Lubrizol uses science to solve massive industrial challenges, and honestly, I love the mission. I’m writing to you because I live and breathe cloud systems, and I want to help make Lubrizol’s digital world as robust and innovative as the physical products you create. I am currently finishing my Master’s at ASU, and I am incredibly excited about the possibility of bringing my energy to your Cloud Security team.

I don’t just "do" cloud work - I’m genuinely fascinated by it. Whether I’m building a new startup from the ground up or helping a large company modernize their old systems, my goal is always the same: make it fast, make it scale, and above all, make it impossible to break. In my recent venture, I’ve been focused on automating the "boring" parts of setting up cloud environments. I managed to cut down the time it takes to set up a secure system by 90\%. To me, that isn't just a technical win; it’s a business win. It means the team can stop worrying about manual setup and start focusing on innovation. I’ve even been experimenting with AI to help write safer code, which has been a total game-changer for speed and reliability.

In my previous roles, I helped companies move away from slow, outdated setups to modern, "serverless" systems that are much easier to manage. This didn't just make the tech better - it reduced errors by 70\% and cut operational costs significantly. I love finding those "win-win" scenarios where the system becomes both safer and cheaper to run at the same time.

I’m looking for a place where I can work with smart people, solve hard problems, and keep pushing the boundaries of what’s possible. I am confident that my mix of technical "know-how" and my "let’s get it done" attitude would make me a great fit for Lubrizol.

I would love the chance to chat with you about how I can help protect and grow your digital infrastructure. Thank you so much for your time and for considering my application!
